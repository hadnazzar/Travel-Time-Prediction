# Travel-Time-Prediction
The purpose of this modelling is to accurately predict the trip duration of taxi's. To make predictions we will use several algorithms, tune the corresponding parameters of the algorithm by analysisng each parameter against RMSE and predict the trip duration. To make our prediction we use RandomForest Regressor, LinearSVR and LinearRegression.
We improved accuracy by tuning hyperparameters and RandomForest gave best accuracy of 83%.
